# üìà Stock Price Prediction using LSTM

This project predicts stock prices using a **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)** neural network built with **TensorFlow and Keras**.  
It performs **time series forecasting** on historical stock data, visualizes stock trends, and compares predicted vs actual closing prices.

## üß† Overview

Stock market prices are sequential and depend on past behavior ‚Äî making **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)** ideal for modeling them.  
In this project, we use **LSTM**, a type of RNN that overcomes the *vanishing gradient problem* and captures long-term dependencies in data.
